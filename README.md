## Final Project website

# Introduction
This is a computer graphics project focusing on scene layout and skyboxes in order to create a 3-D world for users to view. The goal was to create an island landscape where there are a few small islands all around, some containing little trees. The main goal was to implement a skybox and to attempt generating terrain with heightmaps. However, generating heightmaps became complicated and was not gotten to. Instead, different terrain-like objects were loaded in and textured.
